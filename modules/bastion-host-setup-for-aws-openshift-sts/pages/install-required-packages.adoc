3. Page 2 – Install Required Packages

3.1. Objective
The objective of this step is to install all necessary packages on the bastion host to ensure a smooth setup process for AWS OpenShift STS.

3.2. Steps

Follow these steps to install the required packages:

1. **Switch to root**: Begin by elevating your privileges to root using the following command:
   ```
   sudo -i
   ```

2. **Install required packages**: Use the `dnf` and `yum` package managers to install the necessary tools. Execute the following command:
   ```
   dnf install -y tmux wget podman jq golang unzip bind-utils squid openssl-devel git
   yum-utils tigervnc tigervnc-server
   ```
   This command installs the following packages: `tmux`, `wget`, `podman`, `jq`, `golang`, `unzip`, `bind-utils`, `squid`, `openssl-devel`, `git`, `yum-utils`, and `tigervnc-server`.

3. **(Optional) Install GUI group**: If you prefer a graphical user interface, you can install the "Server with GUI" group using the following command:
   ```
   dnf groupinstall -y "Server with GUI"
   ```

4. **Verify installations**: To ensure that the packages have been installed correctly, verify their presence using the following commands:
   ```
   which tmux wget podman git vncserver
   rpm -q tmux wget podman git tigervnc-server
   ```
   These commands should return the full path of the installed binaries, confirming successful installation.

By completing these steps, you will have installed all the required packages on your bastion host, preparing it for the subsequent stages of setting up AWS OpenShift STS.
