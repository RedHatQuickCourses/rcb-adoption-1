#  Configure VNC Server

== Configure VNC Server

This section guides you through the process of creating a vncuser account and configuring TigerVNC to serve on display :99 (port 5999). This setup is crucial for remote graphical access to your AWS OpenShift STS environment.

=== 4.1 Objective

The primary objective of this section is to:

- Create a new user, vncuser, with a set password.
- Configure TigerVNC to map the display :99 to the vncuser account.
- Enable and start the VNC service on the specified display.
- Verify that the VNC service is running and listening on port 5999.
- Optionally, open the firewall port for external access.

=== 4.2 Steps

Follow these steps to configure the VNC server:

1. **Create User and Set Password**

    Execute the following commands to create a new user named 'vncuser' and set its password:

    ```bash
    sudo useradd vncuser
    sudo passwd vncuser
    ```

2. **Configure Display Mapping**

    Add the following line to the /etc/tigervnc/vncserver.users file to map display :99 to the vncuser account:

    ```bash
    echo ':99=vncuser' | sudo tee -a /etc/tigervnc/vncserver.users
    ```

3. **Enable and Start the VNC Service**

    Use the following commands to enable and start the VNC service on display :99:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable vncserver@:99.service
    sudo systemctl start vncserver@:99.service
    ```

4. **Verify**

    Confirm that the VNC service is running and listening on port 5999 by executing:

    ```bash
    sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 5999
    ```

    If the service is running correctly, you should see a line indicating that the vncuser is listening on port 5999.

5. **Optional - Open Firewall Port**

    If you need to access the VNC server from outside the bastion host, open the required firewall port:

    ```bash
    sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=5999/tcp --permanent
    sudo firewall-cmd
